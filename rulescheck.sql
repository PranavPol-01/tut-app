     INSERT INTO Football VALUES("Football", "Football is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups", "The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.\nEach team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players.\nEssentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.","The game starts with a kick-off in the centre circle. The team that wins the coin toss will choose which end to attack in the first half and will kick off. The opposing team must be outside of the centre circle and the team kicking off must be in their own half. The ball must be played forward and cannot be played back. The game is officiated by a referee and two linesman. The referee has full control of the match and his decisions are final. The linesman will assist the referee in certain decisions such as whether the ball has gone out of play, offside decisions and fouls. The game is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first half is completed there is a 15 minute rest period. Any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be added on at the end of each half for stoppages in play. The game will finish after 90 minutes including injury time unless the referee indicates otherwise. If the game is a draw after 90 minutes then the game will go into extra time and penalties if necessary.\nThe offside rule is a rule in football which states that if a player is in an offside position when the ball is played to him or touched by a team mate, he may not become actively involved in the play. A player is in an offside position if he is nearer to his opponents goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent when his team mate plays the ball to him. The offside rule is in place to stop players from simply standing by the oppositions goal waiting for the ball to be played to them. The rule is in place to encourage attacking play and to stop players from simply goal hanging. The offside rule is one of the hardest rules to get right in football and is often the cause of controversy.\nThe penalty rule is a rule in football which states that if a player commits a foul in the 18 yard box a penalty will be awarded. The player who has been fouled will take the penalty from 12 yards out and will have a free shot at goal with only the goalkeeper to beat. The penalty rule is in place to stop players from committing fouls in the 18 yard box and to stop players from simply hacking down an opponent when he is through on goal. The penalty rule is one of the most important rules in football and is often the cause of controversy.","To score the ball must go into your opponent’s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.\n The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
# For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.","The dimensions of a football pitch vary depending on the age group but for a full size pitch the dimensions are 105m x 68m. The penalty area is 16.5m x 40.3m. The penalty spot is 11m from the goal line. The goal area is 5.5m x 18.3m. The goal is 7.32m x 2.44m. The centre circle has a radius of 9.15m. The corner area is a quarter circle with a radius of 1m. The pitch is split into two halves and the halfway line is in the middle of the pitch. The pitch is split into two halves and the halfway line is in the middle of the pitch. The pitch is split into two halves and the halfway line is in the middle of the pitch.", "assets\\fbmedia1.png" , "assets\\fbpage2.png", NULL, "assets\\3-control-skills-to-practice-first-football-soccer-shorts.mp4", "assets\\fbmrdia5.png")
